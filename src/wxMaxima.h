    Old wxMaxima versions play them back in the default speed instead but still
    open the file.
  - Bumped to version 1.2 after saving highlighting was introduced: Older versions
    of wxMaxima will ignore the highlighting on opening .wxmx files.
  - Bumped to version 1.3 after sub-subsections were introduced:
    Old wxMaxima versions interpret them as subsections but still open the file.
  - Bumped to version 1.4 when we started allowing to embed .jpg images in a .wxmx
    file. wxMaxima versions between 13.04 and 15.08 replace these images by a 
    "image cannot be loaded" marker but will correctly display the rest of the file.
  - Bumped to version 1.5 when GroupCells were added an attribute that allows them to
    be used as an answer to questions.
