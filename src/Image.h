/*! Manages an auto-scaling image

  This class keeps two versions of an image:
    - The image in its original compressed format. This way the image can losslessly
      be exported later on
    - A bitmap version of the image that is scaled down to a size that makes sense 
      with the current viewport.

  Storing images this way has many advantages:
    - It allows us to restrict scaling operations to only once on actually drawing 
      the image after a resize of the wxMaxima window.
    - We can keep (and therefore export and save) jpeg photos in their original 
      format instead of using the .png compression that is superior for line art - 
      but not for depicting real-live images.
    - We save time on saving the .wxmx file since image compression, if done good, 
      might need a good deal of time and this class never needs to compress images
      itself.
    - It allows images to keep their metadata, if needed
    - and if we have big images (big plots or for example photographs) we don't need
      to store them in their uncompressed form.
    - One could even delete the cached scaled images for all cells that currently 
      are off-screen in order to save memory.
