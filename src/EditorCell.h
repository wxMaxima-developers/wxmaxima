 */

/*! This class defines what the user sees as input cell
  
  This class handles input cells including:
    - The per-cell undo buffer
    - The handling of key presses when this cell is active
  
  Since Unicode doesn't provide us with a "soft linebreak" letter we 
  use <code>\\r</code> as a marker that this line has to be broken here if we
  don't want it to extend beyond the right margin of the screen.

  In a few places we use wxString::iterator instead of accessing individual 
  letters within the string using the [] operator. This might look overly
  complicated. But in UTF-8 all non-standard-ASCII-characters use more than one
  byte making iterating over every single char of the string the only way of
  determining which address char n is at. An iterator is the only way of not
  having to determine the address of every single char indepently.
