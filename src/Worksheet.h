/*! The canvas that contains the spreadsheet the whole program is about.

This canvas contains all the math-, title-, image- input- ("editor-")- etc.-
cells of the current session.

Most of the logic that handles that this canvas might be larger than the screen
(and could even be larger than the computer's RAM would it have been handled as
a big bitmap) is provided by wxWidgets:
 - If part of the screen needs to be drawn it calls the OnPaint() method.
 - If the canvas is scrolled wxWidgets the parts that are already decides how much
   of the off-screen part of the canvas is cached in a backing store
 - Also if the canvas is scrolled wxWidgets is intelligent enough to only request
   the parts of the new view that aren't available on the screen or in the backing
   store
 - If we call the Refresh() method wxWidgets requests us to draw the entire visible
   part of the worksheet anew and invalidates all cached areas it might have.
 - and the RefreshRect() method notifies wxWidgets that a rectangular region
   contains changes that need to be redrawn.

The worksheet isn't immediately redrawn on a key press, a mouse klick or on
maxima outputting new data. Instead all such events are processed in order until
wxMaxima has caught up with all the events (which causes wxWidgets to send a Idle
event to the wxMaxima object) or until we reach a timeout. If the user manages
to type faster than wxMaxima redraws the screen this allows us to skip
a few redraws in order to process the keypresses as fast as the user types.
Also this keeps us responsive even if maxima outputs data faster than
wxMaxima can display it.

  /*! \defgroup UndoBufferFill Undo methods for cell additions/deletions:

    Each EditorCell has its own private undo buffer Additionally wxMaxima
    maintains a undo buffer for worksheet changes. It works the following way:

     - Cells normally aren't deleted. They are moved into an undo buffer instead.
     - The undo buffer is also notified when Cells that are added
     - If the cursor enters a cell the contents of this cell is saved
     - And if the cell is left and the contents has changed this information
       is kept in the undo buffer, as well.

    The add and delete actions offer to choose which undo buffer to use since
    there are two of them:
     - The normal undo buffer and
     - The buffer that is used instead if a cell change has been issued by the
       undo command so the undo action can be reverted.\n
       This approach allows the undo functionality to use the regular add and
       delete operations keeping the codebase small.
