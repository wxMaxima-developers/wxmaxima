/*!
  The base class all cell types the worksheet can consist of are derived from

  Every Cell is part of two double-linked lists:
   - A Cell does have a member m_previous that points to the previous item
     (or contains a NULL for the head node of the list) and a member named m_next 
     that points to the next cell (or contains a NULL if this is the end node of a list).
   - And there is m_previousToDraw and m_nextToDraw that contain fractions and similar 
     items as one element if they are drawn as a single 2D object that isn't divided by
     a line break, but will contain every single element of a fraction as a separate 
     object if the fraction is broken into several lines and therefore displayed in its
     a linear form.

  Also every list of Cells can be a branch of a tree since every math cell contains
  a pointer to its parent group cell.

  Besides the cell types that are directly user visible there are cells for several
  kinds of items that are displayed in a special way like abs() statements (displayed
  as horizontal rules), subscripts, superscripts and exponents.
  Another important concept realized by a class derived from this one is
  the group cell that groups all things that are foldable in the gui like:
   - A combination of maxima input with the output, the input prompt and the output 
     label.
   - A chapter or a section and
   - Images with their title (or the input cells that generated them)
   .

  \attention Derived classes must test if m_next equals NULL and if it doesn't
  they have to delete() it.

  On systems where wxWidget supports (and is compiled with)
  accessibility features Cell is derived from wxAccessible which
  allows every element in the worksheet to identify itself to an
  eventual screen reader.
