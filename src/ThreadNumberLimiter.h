  How it works:

  * Each thread that tries to avoid running more threads than there are CPUs available
    creates variable of the type ThreadNumberLimiter.
  * This ThreadNumberLimiter at start-up increases m_numberOfBackgroundThreads and waits
    until that number is low enough-
  * When the block the variable was instantiated in ends m_numberOfBackgroundThreads is
    decremented, again.
