@chapter Introduction to wxMaxima
@section Maxima and wxMaxima
In the open-source domain big systems are normally split into smaller
projects that are easier to handle for small groups of developers.
For example a CD burner program will consist of a command-line tool
that actually burns the CD and a graphical user interface that allows
the user to use it without having to learn about all the command-line
switches and in fact without using the commandline at all. One
advantage of this approach is that the developing work that
was invested into the command-line program can be shared by many
programs without having to re-invent the wheel: The same cd-burner
command-line program can be used as a ``send-to-cd''-plug-in for a
file manager application, for the ``burn to CD'' function of a music
player and as the CD writer for a DVD backup tool. Another advantage
is that splitting one big task into smaller parts allows to provide
several user interfaces for the same program: A computer algebra
system could be be the logic behind a arbitrary precision calculator
application, it can do automatic transforms of formulas in the
background of a bigger system (e.G. Sage
@url{http://www.sagemath.org}) or actually used as a full-fledged
computer algebra system (which is the case with wxMaxima).
@subsection Maxima
@cindex CAS
@cindex Computer algebra System
Maxima is a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS). In other
words it is a program specialized in solving mathematical problems by
rearranging formulas and finding a formula solving the problem as
opposed to just outputting the numeric value of the result.

There is extensive documentation for maxima available in the internet
part of which can be found in wxMaxima's help menu.
@subsection wxMaxima
wxMaxima is a graphical user interface that provides the full
functionality and flexibility of maxima providing the user with a
graphical display and many features that make working with maxima
easier. For example wxMaxima allows to export any cell's contents (or,
if that is needed, any part of a formula, as well) as text, as LaTeX
or as MathML specification at a simple right-click.

The calculations itself are done by the maxima command-line
tool in the background.
@section  Worksheet basics
Most of wxMaxima should be self-explaining. One of the very few things
that aren's standard ist that wxMaxima organizes the data for maxima in
cells that are only evaluated (which means: sent to maxima) when the user
request this. This approach might feel unfamiliar at the first sight. But
it drastically eases work with big documents (where the user won't want
every small change at the beginning automatically to trigger a full
re-evaluation of the whole document) and is very handy for debugging.

The cells wxMaxima automatically creates on typing some text are maxima
input cells that will eventually be sent to maxima.

@ifnotinfo
@image{figures/InputCell,12cm}
@end ifnotinfo

On evaluation of an input cell's contents the input cell maxima
assigns a label to the input (by default shown in red and recognizable
by the @code{%i}) by which it can be referenced lateron. The output
maxima generates will be shown in a different style and preceded by maxima
by a label beginning with @code{%o}.

Besides the input cells wxMaxima allows for text cells for
documentation, image cells, title cells, chapter
cells and section cells; Every cell has it's own undo buffer so debugging
by changing the values of several cells and then gradually reverting the
unneeded changes is rather easy.

@section  File Formats
@subsection .mac
@file{.mac} files are ordinary text files that can be read using
maxima's read command:
@example
%i1 read("test.mac");
@end example
They can be used for writing own libraries but since they don't
contain enough structural information they cannot be read back
directly into wxMaxima.
@subsection .wxm
@file{.wxm} files contain the input for maxima, as well as any
text cells, title cells and chapter or section cells the user typed
in. Pictures and maxima's output aren't saved along with the
@file{.wxm} file, though.
@subsection .wxmx
This xml-based file format saves all text and images the work sheet
contains. It is the preferred file format now and due to the
compression it uses normally still results in small files.
