 <summary>A graphical user interface for maxima being a powerful computer algebra system </summary>
 <description>
   <p>
     wxMaxima is a graphical user interface for the computer algebra system Maxima:
     a program that solves mathematical problems by manipulating
     equations (and outputting the resulting formula), instead of just
     calculating a number. wxMaxima eases the use of Maxima by making
     most of its commands available through a menu system and by
     providing input dialogs for commands that require more than one
     argument. It also implements its own display engine that outputs
     mathematical symbols directly instead of depicting them with
     ASCII characters. 
  </p>
  <p>
    wxMaxima also features 2D and 3D inline plots, simple animations,
    mixing of text and mathematical calculations to create documents,
    exporting of input and output to TeX, document structuring and a
    browser for Maxima's manual including command index and full text
    searching.
