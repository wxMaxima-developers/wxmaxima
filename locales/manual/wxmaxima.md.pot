"In the open-source domain, big systems are normally split into smaller "
"projects that are easier to handle for small groups of developers. For "
"example a CD burner program will consist of a command-line tool that "
"actually burns the CD and a graphical user interface that allows users to "
"implement it without having to learn about all the command line switches and "
"in fact without using the command line at all. One advantage of this "
"approach is that the developing work that was invested into the command-line "
"program can be shared by many programs: The same CD-burner command-line "
"program can be used as a “send-to-CD”-plug-in for a file manager "
"application, for the “burn to CD” function of a music player and as the "
"CD writer for a DVD backup tool. Another advantage is that splitting one big "
"task into smaller parts allows the developers to provide several user "
"interfaces for the same program."

"One of the very few things that are not standard in _wxMaxima_ is that it "

"sent to _Maxima_) only when the user requests this. When a cell is "
"evaluated, all commands in that cell, and only that cell, are evaluated as a "
"batch. (The preceding statement is not quite accurate: One can select a set "
"of adjacent cells and evaluate them together. Also, one can instruct "
"_Maxima_ to evaluate all cells in a workbook in one pass.) _WxMaxima_’s "
"approach to submitting commands for execution might feel unfamiliar at the "
"first sight. It does, however, drastically ease work with big documents "
"(where the user does not want every change to automatically trigger a full "
"re-evaluation of the whole document). Also, this approach is very handy for "
