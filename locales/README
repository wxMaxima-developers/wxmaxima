Translations are an important aspect of open-source programs. Any help with them
is always appreciated.

In order to translate wxMaxima to a new language two things have to been done:
 - Translate wxMaxima.pot to your language.
   If you don't translate everything in one go that is to be expected: Quality
   is more important than quantity here and getmessage will be able to work with
   a partially-translated program just fine.
   If one of the messages contained in the wxMaxima.pot from the git repository
   changes while your work is still in progress, this is no problem, neither:
   msgmerge will find a solution to this.
 - For Linux desktop integration additionally data/wxMaxima.desktop
   additionally needs to be equipped with a translation.
