<li>Keep the wxm/mac difference when saving wxm/exporting mac. This omits unneeded comments (/* [<a class="el" href="classwxMaxima.html">wxMaxima</a>: input start ] */ (and input end) in a mac file (structural comments (section, ...) are still saved) and especially omits question/answer comments - they are unreadable by <a class="el" href="classMaxima.html" title="Interface to the Maxima process.">Maxima</a> (see #2014, not only wxm files but also mac files were problematic). At least the issue with mac files is solved.</li>
<li>Replace unicode fractions in math input.</li>
<li>Use wxArtProvider images for the copy/print icons in the config dialogue. They were very small on Linux (Ubuntu).</li>
<li>Support webp images if wxWidgets &gt;= 3.3.0 is used.</li>
<li>Fix the General Math sidebar resize issue (#2022).</li>
<li>Fix the resizing of the 'Insert cell' sidebar (same problem as the 'General Math' sidebar).</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md144"></a>
25.04.0</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use the (standard) wxWidgets log window instead of our own log pane. Less code to maintain, more features (e.g. clear log, save log). In "Release" builds the log window will be hidden (and can be enabled using View-&gt;Toggle log window, otherwise it is shown.</li>
<li>Make the option "--logtostderr" work on Windows. (Windows GUI applications do not have STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR assigned, an extra 'text window' with the log messages will be opened at startup).</li>
<li>Do not set lmxchar/rmxchar (used for displaying a matrix in text mode). It did not work at all. <a class="el" href="classMaxima.html" title="Interface to the Maxima process.">Maxima</a> provides a reasonable default - and people probably expect the same, if they are using command line <a class="el" href="classMaxima.html" title="Interface to the Maxima process.">Maxima</a> and <a class="el" href="classwxMaxima.html">wxMaxima</a>. (#1926)</li>
<li>Kill Lisp (e.g. sbcl.exe) when closing <a class="el" href="classwxMaxima.html">wxMaxima</a>. (#1963, #1922, #1824, #1199)</li>
<li>Correct heading colors (#2005)</li>
<li>Repaired the Equations-&gt;Solve numerical-&gt;Find numerical solution" menu (#2010)

  The generated content.xml was empty, which was no valid XML.
