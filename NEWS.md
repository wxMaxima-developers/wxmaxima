# Why is wxMaxima able to open truncated wxmx files?

.wxmx Files are technically .zip files like .pptx- files,
.docx- files and .xlsx-files. If you ever want to extract an image
in the original format (or remove a nasty write protection) you can
always rename the document to an .zip file and look at its internal 
structure.

Since .zip files, when broken, can be hard to handle wxMaxima invests
a big effort in making sure that saving succeeds:

 * First the file is saved to a .wxmx~-file. If anything goes wrong in
   this step the original .wxmx-file is still there and unharmed.
 * After saving the file wxMaxima tests if the .wxmx~-file is a valid
   . zip file that can still be opened.
 * It also tests if the content.xml (which contains everything except
   the images) inside the .zip archive can be read and is valid xml.
 * Only then it moves the file to the final location - which doesn't 
   physically move the data, but just changes the directory entry to
   point from the correct name to the correct file.
 * And since on one operating system virus scanners can prevent this
   last step while they still are scanning the file wxMaxima tests if
   the move has been successful and re-tries the move, if necessary.

In theory nothing can go wrong here, except if the storage device is
faulty, cosmic rays have altered a write cache before the data was 
actually written or the file has been altered by an external program.
Even in that case not everything is lost, though:

 * The text part of the .wxmx file isn't compressed, so it can be 
   viewed when opening the .wxmx file using a text editor.
 * Also the text part of the .wxmx file is always to be found near 
   the very beginning of the .wxmx file.
 
This means that even if there should be a bad block somewhere in the 
middle of the file chances that wxMaxima will be able to restore at 
least the text and code part automatically are relatively high.

# Multi-Threading
Most modern computers allow to use more than CPU core at a time.
This can greatly boost the performance of an application. But there
are tasks that are not suited for that:
 * Essentially everything that involves GUI actions is not thread-save.
   The main purpose of wxMaxima is providing a GUI, though.
 * Loops in which every run requires knowing the result of the last cannot
   be split into multiple threads. This includes most of the string and 
   list processing.
 * If the program needs the result now trying to calculate this result 
   in a separate thread doesn't help.
 * If a task is memory-limited and accesses memory in a linear way dividing 
   the task into threads can increase the memory access times (due to 
   constantly switching memory rows)
 * Additionally for short operations the overhead of starting a new 
   thread is way higher than the gain
This means wxMaxima can use multiple threads. But the number of places
this is possible in is surprisingly low.

# Transition to C++11 - Part II

Many annoying bugs have to do with memory management. Typical examples are:
 * Out-of-bonds reads and writes: n+1 bytes of an n-bytes-long string are
   read or written.
 * Use of uninitialized memory: Memory is first read and then set to the
   value that one would have wanted to read from it.
 * Use-after-free: Memory was first marked as "free" and then used again.
 * Memory Leaks: Memory isn't marked as "free" even if it is no more used.
Against the last two of these bugs C++11 offers automatic pointers that
stay allocated while they are in used and then are automatically marked
as free. In the next wxMaxima release about 2500 lines will be changed
in order to make use of that functionality.

# Transition to C++11

The next wxMaxima release will make use of C++11 features: I *hope* that C++
has been out long enough in 2019 that every relevant compiler supports it.
C++11 brings in features that allow to make compilation fail on otherwise
hard-to-detect bugs, some features that might make the code easier to read...
...and I am afraid that plain old c++ might look antiquated one day.

Additionally it will contain many bug fixes hoping that I won't fix bugs that
in retrospect didn't exist... ...on the plus side the program should again
have gotten faster by giving the compiler additional hints for optimization
and the transition has shrunk wxMaxima by about 100 lines. Much help with
finding bugs came from the cppcheck utility which caused changes in over
1700 lines of code, mainly in order to prevent possible future bugs.

    MathJaX from a different URL: They moved the URL one can use and might do so
    again somewhere in the future.
  * Maximum number of digits and if we use user-defined labels now are no more
    hardcoded into the worksheet at evaluation time.
  * Anwers to Maxima's questions are now remembered across sessions.
  * CMake is now our main build system: It is supported under MSVC, Xcode,
    Code::Blocks, its output looks much nicer than the one from the autotools

    output of a cell.
  * An all-new manual and improved documentation of the source code.
  * More unicode characters in the symbols pane
  * Several content assistent enhancements for platforms that support it.
  * Corrected a few scrolling bugs.
  * Shift+Click now selects text or cells.
  * Several small editor enhancements.
  * Even if we scrolled away from evaluation wxMaxima now scrolls back to the
    cell if an error occurs.
  * Integrals should now always be saved correctly.
  * Errors in xml from Maxima or in the output cells of .wxmx files now result in error
    messages, not in silently discarded math elements.

# 16.04
  * A TeX-like subscript notation: A_1 is now by default shown as an A with
    an 1 as subscript
  * High-quality icons for high-dpi screens.
  * Some broken .wxmx files generated with wxMaxima 13.04 and older will now
    automatically be repaired
  * Tried to make communication with Maxima more stable
  * Debug: A monitor for the xml communication between Maxima and wxMaxima
  * Leading White-space in front of a character that has to be escaped in
    XML is no more ignored.
  * jpeg-encoded images are now no more converted to much larger png files
    on saving .wxmx files and on exporting.
  * Images will now actually be converted to the target format.
  * Bumped the minor version of the .wxmx format: Some old versions of
    wxMaxima will replace .jpg files embedded in .wxmx files by a
    placeholder on load
  * Increased both speed and memory-efficiency of image handling
  * Save the zoom factor at exit and reload it on opening a new file
  * An option that makes wxMaxima use user-defined labels instead of %o where an
    user-defined label exists. Works well together with unchecking the
    "export code cells" config item.
  * A separate text style for user-defined labels.
  * The "evaluate all cells" and "evaluate till here" now start with a fresh
    instance of Maxima
  * TeX export now should work with most unicode chars we have ESC sequences
    for.
  * An auto-repair functionality that repairs most .wxmx files wxMaxima 13.04
    was not able to open again.
  * A few new ESC sequences and markdown commands.
  * "#" now is shown as a "not equal" sign as a "not equal" sign already would
    be interpreted as "#".
  * Teach CCL on Windows how to deal with unicode variable names like
    ü and α. For SBCL the necessary change has been done on the Maxima side.
  * Sidebars for symbols
  * Printing text cells now works again
  * The <ESC> key now works as a shortcut that closes the search dialogue.
  * A copy-to-MathML feature
  * Many bug, usability and performance fixes
  * Most importantly: If it is a cursor it now blinks.

# 15.08
  * Compatibility with Maxima 5.37.0
  * MathJAX now provides scalable equations and extended drag-and-drop for the html export.
  * The table-of-contents-sidebar now shows the current cursor position
  * Fixed a few instances of cursors jumping out of the screen
  * Fixed a few instances of cursors jumping to the beginning or end of the worksheet
  * Better detection which cell Maxima is processing and if it still is doing so
  * Regression: Hiding the toolbar didn't work on some systems
  * Markdown support for <=, >=, <=>, <-, ->, <->, => and +/- symbols.
  * An option to not export Maxima's input as well as the output.
  * An option to use High-resolution bitmaps for the HTML export.
  * Images that are too big for the window now are displayed in a scaled-down version.
  * Fixed the support for out-of-tree-bulds that was broken in 15.04
  * Meaningful ALT texts for the HTML export to provide accessibility
  * An option to include the .wxmx file in the .html export
  * Performance fixes that are espectionally effective for MSW
  * Unification of some platform-specific code
  * bash autocompletion
  * A fourth sectioning level
  * Made entering uppercase greek letters easier and documented how to input special
	unicode symbols
  * Syntax highlighting in code cells
  * Automatic highlighting of text equal to the currently selected one.
  * A batch mode that pauses evaluation if Maxima asks a question.
  * A "halt on error" feature
  * Now evaluation of a new command is only triggered if evaluation of the last
	command has finished. This means that output from Maxima is always appended
	to the right cell.
  * Un-broke error and question handling for multiple commands per cell. Sincewe now send
	Maxima's input command-per-command this means a cell with multiple commands is no
	more evaluated faster than multiple cells with single commands each.
  * If ever a end-of-evaluation marker gets lost there is a new "trigger evaluation"
	menu entry in the Maxima menu.
  * On wxGtk autocompletion was replaced by a content assistant that is based on the
	surprisingly powerful autocompletion feature.
  * Ctrl+Tab now launches the autocompletion (or content assistant, if available)
  * Tab and Shift+Tab now indent and unindent regions.
  * Ctrl+Mouse wheel and Ctrl++/- now zoom in and out of the worksheet.
  * Allow Extending selection from part of a single cell to multiple cells.
  * A Autoindent functionality.

# 15.04.0
  * wxWidgets 3.0 is now a mandatory requirement
  * Various bugfixes
  * Loads of stability and performance fixes
  * Adjustable framerate for animations
  * A version-control friendly flavour of the wxmx format
  * A mimetype marker at the beginning of wxmx files
  * Better desktop integration
  * An offline manual

  * Use gnuplot_postamble instead of gnuplot_preamble
  * Dropped the hard dependency of TeXinfo
  * Translation updates
  * LaTeX: Use centered dots for multiplications
  * LaTeX: Added an option to select if superscripts should be
    placed above or after subscripts
  * LaTeX: Allow the user to add additional commands to the preamble.
  * Export of animations to pdf (via a pdfTeX file run) and html
  * Now complex conjugates are drawn as overstrike text.
  * bumped the minor version number of .wxmx: overstrike text is
    a new feature and therefore a file containing it cannot be read by
    old wxMaxima versions.
  * An autosave functionality that makes Maxima work more like a mobile
    app whose documents are always saved.
  * A table-of-contents pane for faster navigation
  * It is now possible to scroll away from a running evaluation for
    arbitrary lengths of time and to choose to follow the evaluation
    process again.
  * Now TeX scales down images that are obviously too big for the page.
  * An undo for cell deletes and for adding cells.
  * Autocompletion for units from ezUnits
