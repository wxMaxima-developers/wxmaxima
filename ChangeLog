Current:
  * Defer any try to change Maxima's configuration until all questions are answered.
  * A menu item that sets the autosubscript feature for the current worksheet.
  * A menu allowing to switch floats to engineering format.
  * Maxima can now pass the values of variables to wxMaxima.

    dependencies to a minimum.
  * Big performance improvements, again.

18.02:
  * More tooltips
  * A menu containing the most important commands for lists.
  * TableOfContents: A right-click menu item that allows to toggle display of section numbers
  * The size of images can now be restricted to any amount of centimeters.

  * If an input cell is hidden and has no output it now is no more displayed
    as a blank vertical space.
  * wxMaxima no more requires the icon files, tooltips and autocompletion files to be
    shipped as separate files, which makes creating a ready-to-install package of wxMaxima
    easier and less error-prone.
  * Autosave is now enabled by default on new installs.
  * Big code cleanups.
  * Many bugfixes
  * Many performance improvements

17.10:
  * Jump to the char containing the error on encountering unmatched parenthesis.
  * Try to place the cursor near the error in all other cases.
  * Attempt to mark the whole error message in red. This is bound to fail in
    some cases as Maxima sometimes only sends part of an error message through
    the error() command. But it is better than nothing.
  * Detect and mark most warnings.
  * A "evaluate cells below" right-click-menu item.
  * Autosave now even works for unsaved documents adding them to the
    "recent documents" list if needed.

    Double-clicking this indicator opens up the network monitor.
  * Autocompletion now collects words from the current code cell, too.
  * Better indentation of if clauses and loops.
  * If the number is too long to display it now is still possible to copy it.
  * Documented that box() highlights text in Maxima's output.
  * the with_slider type of commands now uses wxstatusbar() in order to provide
  * progress information for the user.
  * Several scrolling fixes, again.
  * Two concurrent wxMaxima instances now no more overwrite each other's "Recent files"
    list.
  * If a error message or question arises or Maxima finishes calculating and the window
    currently isn't active the operating system is asked to notify the user in a
    non-disrupting way. For the case of the end of a calculation this can be turned off.
  * The notification can be activated for the case that the window isn't active and Maxima
    finishes calculating, too.
  * Invalid XML tags are now handled more gracefully
  * Deduplicated the code for saving .wxm files

    using a text editor as UTF8-encoded TeXt without BOM can now be loaded by
    wxMaxima in order to reconstruct the worksheet.
  * MacOs: Upgrading from a previous version should no more cause crashes due to
    font issues.
  * MathJaX export can now be configured to instruct the html export to download
    MathJaX from a different URL: They moved the URL one can use and might do so
    again somewhere in the future.
  * Maximum number of digits and if we use user-defined labels now are no more
    hardcoded into the worksheet at evaluation time.
  * Anwers to Maxima's questions are now remembered across sessions.
  * CMake is now our main build system: It is supported under MSVC, XCode,
    Code::Blocks, its output looks much nicer than the one from the autotools
    and setting it up uses much more straightforward constructs.
    The recipe to build a debian package using cmake can be found at
    https://code.launchpad.net/~peterpall/wxmaxima/packaging
  * Massive speed-ups
  * File/Open can now import .mac and .out files from Xmaxima

  * Debug: A monitor for the xml communication between Maxima and wxMaxima
  * Leading White-space in front of a character that has to be escaped in
    XML is no more ignored.
  * jpeg-encoded images are now no more converted to much larger png files
    on saving .wxmx files and on exporting.

    wxMaxima will replace .jpg files embedded in .wxmx files by a
    placeholder on load
  * Increased both speed and memory-efficiency of image handling
  * Save the zoom factor at exit and reload it on opening a new file
  * An option that makes wxMaxima use user-defined labels instead of %o where an
    user-defined label exists. Works well together with unchecking the
    "export code cells" config item.
  * A separate text style for user-defined labels.
  * The "evaluate all cells" and "evaluate till here" now start with a fresh
    instance of Maxima
  * TeX export now should work with most unicode chars we have ESC sequences
    for.
  * An auto-repair functionality that repairs most .wxmx files wxMaxima 13.04
    was not able to open again.

	to the right cell.
  * Un-broke error and question handling for multiple commands per cell. Sincewe now send
	Maxima's input command-per-command this means a cell with multiple commands is no
	more evaluated faster than multiple cells with single commands each.
  * If ever a end-of-evaluation marker gets lost there is a new "trigger evaluation"
	menu entry in the Maxima menu.
  * On wxGtk autocompletion was replaced by a content assistant that is based on the
	surprisingly powerful autocompletion feature.
