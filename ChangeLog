Current:
  * Jump to the char containing the error on encountering unmatched parenthesis.
  * Try to place the cursor near the error in all other cases.
  * Attempt to mark the whole error message in red.
  * Detect and mark most warnings.
  * A "evaluate cells below" right-click-menu item.
  * Autosave now even works for unsaved documents adding them to the
    "recent documents" list if needed.
  * Big parenthesis are now drawn using unicode characters, if available.
  * Nicer integral, Product and Sum signs, optionally including antialiassing
    even if no font provides them.
  * MouseOver tooltip for some of the most exotic worksheet items.
  * A "Copy as svg" function that is as good as wxSVGFileDc allows us to be.
  * Worksheet objects now can provide their own ToolTips.
  * Config Dialogue: An editor for the startup file.
  * Now multiple animations can run concurrently and can be told to autostart.
  * A menu entry that allows to select 1D and ASCII Art Maths
  * Recent files that currently don't exist are grayed out now.

    Double-clicking this indicator opens up the network monitor.
  * Autocompletion now collects words from the current code cell, too.
  * Better indentation of if clauses and loops.
  * If the number is too long to display it now is still possible to copy it.
  * Documented that box() highlights text in maxima's output.
  * the with_slider type of commands now uses wxstatusbar() in order to provide
  * progress information for the user.
  * Several scrolling fixes, again.
  * Two concurrent wxMaxima instances now no more overwrite each other's "Recent files"
    list.
  * If a error message or question arises or maxima finishes calculating and the window
    currently isn't active the operating system is asked to notify the user in a
    non-disrupting way. For the case of the end of a calculation this can be turned off.
  * The notification can be activated for the case that the window isn't active and maxima
    finishes calculating, too.
  * Invalid XML tags are now handled more gracefully
  * Deduplicated the code for saving .wxm files

    using a text editor as UTF8-encoded TeXt without BOM can now be loaded by
    wxMaxima in order to reconstruct the worksheet.
  * MacOs: Upgrading from a previous version should no more cause crashes due to
    font issues.
  * MathJaX export can now be configured to instruct the html export to download
    MathJaX from a different URL: They moved the URL one can use and might do so
    again somewhere in the future.
  * Maximum number of digits and if we use user-defined labels now are no more
    hardcoded into the worksheet at evaluation time.
  * Anwers to maxima's questions are now remembered across sessions.

    Code::Blocks, its output looks much nicer than the one from the autotools
    and setting it up uses much more straightforward constructs.
    The recipe to build a debian package using cmake can be found at
    https://code.launchpad.net/~peterpall/wxmaxima/packaging
  * Massive speed-ups
  * File/Open can now import .mac and .out files from Xmaxima
  * Many additional bug fixes and stability enhancements.

    maxima has dropped.

    messages, not in silently discarded math elements.

  * Some broken .wxmx files generated with wxMaxima 13.04 and older will now
    automatically be repaired
  * Tried to make communication with maxima more stable
  * Debug: A monitor for the xml communication between maxima and wxMaxima
  * Leading White-space in front of a character that has to be escaped in
    XML is no more ignored.
  * jpeg-encoded images are now no more converted to much larger png files
    on saving .wxmx files and on exporting.
  * Images will now actually be converted to the target format.

    wxmaxima will replace .jpg files embedded in .wxmx files by a
    placeholder on load
  * Increased both speed and memory-efficiency of image handling
  * Save the zoom factor at exit and reload it on opening a new file
  * An option that makes wxMaxima use user-defined labels instead of %o where an
    user-defined label exists. Works well together with unchecking the
    "export code cells" config item.
  * A separate text style for user-defined labels.
  * The "evaluate all cells" and "evaluate till here" now start with a fresh
    instance of maxima

  * Now evaluation of a new command is only triggered if evaluation of the last
	command has finished. This means that output from maxima is always appended
	to the right cell.
  * Un-broke error and question handling for multiple commands per cell. Sincewe now send
	maxima's input command-per-command this means a cell with multiple commands is no
	more evaluated faster than multiple cells with single commands each.
  * If ever a end-of-evaluation marker gets lost there is a new "trigger evaluation"
	menu entry in the maxima menu.
  * On wxGtk autocompletion was replaced by a content assistant that is based on the
	surprisingly powerful autocompletion feature.

    a new feature and therefore a file containing it cannot be read by
    old wxMaxima versions.
  * An autosave functionality that makes maxima work more like a mobile
    app whose documents are always saved.
  * A table-of-contents pane for faster navigation
  * It is now possible to scroll away from a running evaluation for
    arbitrary lengths of time and to choose to follow the evaluation
