    easier and less error-prone.
  * Autosave is now enabled by default on new installs.
  * Big code cleanups.
  * Many bugfixes

    list.
  * If a error message or question arises or Maxima finishes calculating and the window

    finishes calculating, too.

  * MacOs: Upgrading from a previous version should no more cause crashes due to
    font issues.
  * MathJaX export can now be configured to instruct the html export to download
    MathJaX from a different URL: They moved the URL one can use and might do so
    again somewhere in the future.
  * Maximum number of digits and if we use user-defined labels now are no more
    hardcoded into the worksheet at evaluation time.
  * Anwers to Maxima's questions are now remembered across sessions.
  * CMake is now our main build system: It is supported under MSVC, XCode,
    Code::Blocks, its output looks much nicer than the one from the autotools
    and setting it up uses much more straightforward constructs.
    The recipe to build a debian package using cmake can be found at

    user-defined label exists. Works well together with unchecking the
    "export code cells" config item.
  * A separate text style for user-defined labels.
  * The "evaluate all cells" and "evaluate till here" now start with a fresh
    instance of Maxima

	to the right cell.
  * Un-broke error and question handling for multiple commands per cell. Sincewe now send
	Maxima's input command-per-command this means a cell with multiple commands is no
	more evaluated faster than multiple cells with single commands each.
  * If ever a end-of-evaluation marker gets lost there is a new "trigger evaluation"
	menu entry in the Maxima menu.
  * On wxGtk autocompletion was replaced by a content assistant that is based on the
	surprisingly powerful autocompletion feature.
