# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We always support the latest version: wxMaxima tends to evolve quite fast and we don't have a big teams that can maintain backports. But if a security fix for an old version is posted to the admins it is possible to make security releases for old versions, as well.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For privately reporting security vulnerabilities in the C++ code @KubaO and @gunterkoenigsmann should be the right persons to contact.
